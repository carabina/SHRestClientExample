SHRestClient is more of a boiler plate rather than a normal rest-client, including progress hud/_(which you can change or customize)_. It includes Network Observer for watching connectivity which is based upon [ReachabilitySwift Library!](https://github.com/ashleymills/Reachability.swift). It can be used for low to medium network complexity project, with basic **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE** requests.

It also supports codables of swift 4. It supports chaining of whole process to make a request for fetching data which helps in easy and minimal coding.
